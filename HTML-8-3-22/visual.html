            The experience includes the opportunity to see the inflation of the balloon and after that the take-off
            begins, where, although the pilot takes care of the stability of the flight, the wind is in charge of giving
            the direction of the route. For this same reason, you never know where you are going to land; being a
            relatively flat terrain where you find farms within large plots, the sector facilitates landing in any of
            these sites.
            According to Ivan, although people are accustomed to his unexpected landings, many people have bothered with
            him for performing these without warning, "when they get angry, all I do is deflate the balloon and go fast,
            but in general people like it, because when there are children I let the balloon fly about three meters tied
            and I raise them..." claimed.
            <br><br>
            You have to get ahead at dawn and cross the Nile in a fal√∫a while having a light breakfast. When arriving at
            the space where the balloons are concentrated, the pilots give simple instructions on how to react when
            going to land, how to get on the nacelle and how to get on the post. The ascent is smooth and from there we
            slide floating as if by magic. Physical magic, but magic. And at our feet appears the splendid Valley of the
            Kings, the place chosen by the pharaohs to rest their mortal remains. If you have visited on foot before,
            the panorama will surprise us even more. The flights cost about 90 euros per person and the groups are
            usually about ten or more passengers. In silence it is an experience that overcomes the passage of time.
